This is a simple profile publisher project that was implemented with the main purpose of showing how to build a custom authentication system on top of django auth. 

Main features:

* Extend the django User model to have two custom profile models (private and public profile).

* Customize some of the registration and authentication templates (inside the profiles folder).

Additional resources:

* Twitter bootstrap - front-end framework for faster and easier web development. Check out http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap for more information.

* https://github.com/jessemiller/HamlPy - use a Haml like syntax for your Django templates.
